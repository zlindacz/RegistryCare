# Registry Care

##### [Heroku Link]()

### Minimum Viable Product

Registry Care is a web application inspired by THankful Registry and Donor Choose, built using Ruby on Rails and React/Redux.

The finished product by the end of Week 9 will provide interfaces for not-for-profit organizations to create registries for needed resources, and for users to find organizations to which to donate.

The finished app will satisfy the following criteria with smooth, bug-free navigation, sufficient CSS styling, and adequate seed-data for simulations of the user-experience from both the organization's and the individual user's perspectives:

 - Hosting on Heroku
 - New account creation, log in, and a full demo
 - Search feature with Google Maps API
 - Favorites for users to save organizations
 - Follows for users to get updates from organizations
 - Tags for items requested by organizations
 - A production README
